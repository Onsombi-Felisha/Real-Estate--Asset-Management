# Project Overview
The objective of this analysis is to evaluate and optimise real estate asset management strategies based on key metrics such as occupancy rates, square footage, and property values. By examining these metrics across different properties, asset managers can identify trends, areas for improvement, and opportunities to enhance occupancy levels and property values, ultimately maximising returns on investment and portfolio performance.
# Analysis
## Occupancy Analysis
Here we will evaluate the following:

●	Analyse average occupancy rates across different properties.

●	Identify properties with high and low occupancy rates.

●	Assess trends in occupancy rates over time and by property type.

## Square Footage Analysis
Under this analysis we will evaluate the following:

●	Evaluate the distribution of gross leasable area (GLA) across properties.

●	Analyse the ratio of occupied square footage to total GLA.

●	Identify opportunities to optimise space utilisation and maximise occupancy.

## Property Value Assessment
Under this section we will evaluate the following:

●	Evaluate the distribution of gross leasable area (GLA) across properties.

●	Analyse the ratio of occupied square footage to total GLA.

●	Identify opportunities to optimise space utilisation and maximise occupancy.

# Machine Learning Model
